This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the `continue` statement in a C `while` loop. The code seems straightforward but contains a logical error that's easy to miss. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop body for a specific condition, but it's important to understand how this impacts the loop's overall execution flow. The solution explains how to correctly handle this situation.
